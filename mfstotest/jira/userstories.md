### Stopwatch user stories

1. As a user, I should see time displayed in the following format:
hh:mm:ss:cc - hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds. When I open the app, stopwatch should display 00:00:00:00.

2. When I press *start* button, timer should start running. *Pause* button should pause the stopwatch. *Reset* button should set the stopwach back to 00:00:00:00.

3. Optionally, I would like to have *Lap* button, to be able to measure time that passed between two clicks. If the *Lap* button is used, I would like to see the results on the screen.

4. As a user, I would like to be able to reset list of laps.
